## Introduction
Given the function below - 

$$ Y = f(X) + \epsilon$$
  
$Y$ - Response / Dependent / Output variable  
$X$ - Predictor / Independent / Input variable  
$\epsilon$ - Random error with 0 mean  
  
$X$ could be a set of ($X_1,X_2 ... X_p$  ) variables.  
*Statistical learning* is a set of approaches used to estimate $f$ (the real relationship of $Y$ and $X$) in the above function.  
  
## Importance of $f$
  
In statistical learing the interest with $f$ broadly has 2 reasons - 

### Prediction
  
### Inference
