# INTRODUCTION TO STATISTICAL LEARNING - NOTES AND EXERCISES


## INTRO
The repository holds my work in taking a self taught approach towards my dip into the world of data science. As of early 2019, I work as a data analyst and hope to become a data scientist by 2021.

The main source material on this learning Journey comes from [An Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in R] by the authors

* Gareth James
* Daniela Witten
* Trevor Hastie
* Robert Tibshirani

The contents of this project come directly from the book and thus would include -

* [Statistical Learning](https://github.com/aniruddha-panwar/ISLR/tree/master/Ch02%20-%20Statistical%20Learning)
* Linear Regression
* Classification
* [Resampling Methods](https://github.com/aniruddha-panwar/ISLR/tree/master/Ch05%20-%20Resampling%20Methods)
* Linear Model Selection and Regularization
* Moving Beyond Linearity
* Tree-Based Methods
* Support Vector Machines
* Unsupervised Learning

Each topic would contain a Lab file that has notes and lab code and an Applied file that contains answers to exercises from the books.
